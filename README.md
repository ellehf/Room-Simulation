# 174A Final Project

# Proposal: 
Animating Objects in Water

Theme:
This project will be an animation of objects floating in water. 
The user will be able to put varying objects into the water with varying densities that will sink or float. 
These objects will also have animations corresponding to their floating in the water. 
These objects will have corresponding shadows on the floor of the water as well as reflections on the surface of the water.
