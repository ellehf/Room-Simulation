Theme:
Our project will be an animation of objects floating in water. 
The user will be able to put varying objects into the water with varying densities that will sink or float. 
These objects will also have animations corresponding to their floating in the water. 
These objects will have corresponding shadows on the floor of the water as well as reflections on the surface of the water. 

Below is a sketch of what our project should eventually look like. 
There are varying objects that are floating in different depths within the water that cast shadows and reflections.


Topics from course:
This simulation will use the basic construction of shapes that we have learned from assignments one and two. 
We will also use the knowledge from class to animate the objects to animate their sinking motion. 
Once these blocks reach their positions, we will also animate their floating motion in the water. 
We will also use shadows for the objects in the water. 

Interactivity:
We plan to allow users to drop blocks and spheres of varying densities into the water. 
We may also allow the users to change the location and intensity of the light, which will update the shadows of the blocks. 

Advanced features:
We will be using shadowing to create shadows for the blocks within the water. 
As a stretch goal, we may also implement reflection to create reflections of the blocks that float on top of the water.
